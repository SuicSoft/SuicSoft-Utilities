#How do I use Little's PDF Merge Core
LPM.Core (Little's PDF Merge Core) is a free and open source pdf merger library for C#.NET, VB.NET and other .NET programming languages.

For c#.

 using (SuicSoft.LittleSoft.LittlesPDFMerge.Core.Combiner comb = new SuicSoft.LittleSoft.LittlesPDFMerge.Core.Combiner())
                    {
                        comb.OutputPath = "youroutputpath";
                        comb.AddFile(System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes("somepath"), null); //Replace null with password as a byte array if needed
                        comb.AddFile(System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes("somepath"), null); //Replace null with password as a byte array if needed
